From the garage startup to the iPhone, Jobs revolutionized six industries through relentless focus on design, user experience, and integration. A study in the costs and rewards of uncompromising excellence.","summary_medium":"<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>Steve Jobs gave Isaacson unprecedented access, requesting an honest portrait rather than a puff piece. The result is a complex picture of a man who changed the world but hurt many people along the way.</p><h2>The Reality Distortion Field</h2><p>Jobs could convince people to do the impossible—and then make it happen. This 'reality distortion field' inspired breakthroughs and burnout in equal measure.</p><h2>Design Philosophy</h2><p>Jobs believed design wasn't decoration but function. Simplicity required saying no to features. Integration of hardware and software created superior experiences. Beauty mattered because users could feel quality.</p><h2>The Product Launches</h2><p>Mac, iPod, iPhone, iPad—each product redefined its category. Jobs's showmanship and attention to detail made launches into cultural events.</p><h2>The Human Costs</h2><p>Jobs was notoriously difficult: berating employees, denying paternity, parking in handicapped spaces. The biography doesn't excuse this behavior—it shows how genius and cruelty coexisted.</p>"}
