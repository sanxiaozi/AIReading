  "summary_short": "沃尔特·艾萨克森（Walter Isaacson）的授权传记揭示了史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）是一个复杂的天才：既有远见，又有残忍；既是完美主义者，又是规则的破坏者。从车库创业到iPhone，乔布斯通过对设计、用户体验和整合的不懈关注，革新了六个行业。这是一项关于不妥协的卓越带来的代价和回报的研究。",
  "summary_medium": "<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>Steve Jobs gave Isaacson unprecedented access, requesting an honest portrait rather than a puff piece. The result is a complex picture of a man who changed the world but hurt many people along the way.</p><h2>The Reality Distortion Field</h2><p>Jobs could convince people to do the impossible—and then make it happen. This 'reality distortion field' inspired breakthroughs and burnout in equal measure.</p><h2>Design Philosophy</h2><p>Jobs believed design wasn't decoration but function. Simplicity required saying no to features. Integration of hardware and software created superior experiences. Beauty mattered because users could feel quality.</p><h2>The Product Launches</h2><p>Mac, iPod, iPhone, iPad—each product redefined its category. Jobs's showmanship and attention to detail made launches into cultural events.</p><h2>The Human Costs</h2><p>Jobs was notoriously difficult: berating employees, denying paternity, parking in handicapped spaces. The biography doesn't excuse this behavior—it shows how genius and cruelty coexisted.</p>"
