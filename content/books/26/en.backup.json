Despite repeated exiles for his political honesty, Su transformed suffering into sublime poetry and prose. A masterwork about how to live a full life.","summary_medium":"<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>Su Dongpo was a Renaissance man before the Renaissance: poet, painter, calligrapher, engineer, gourmet, pharmacologist, and political reformer. Lin Yutang, himself a master prose stylist, wrote this biography to show Western readers the Chinese ideal of the complete human being.</p><h2>The Poet's Character</h2><p>Su Dongpo's defining trait was his irrepressible spirit. Exiled multiple times for criticizing government policies, he responded not with bitterness but with some of his finest poetry. He found joy in cooking, drinking with friends, and contemplating nature.</p><h2>Art from Adversity</h2><p>His most famous works came from his most difficult periods. The Red Cliffs poems, written during exile, meditate on impermanence and find peace in nature. Suffering refined rather than diminished his genius.</p><h2>A Philosophy of Life</h2><p>Su Dongpo integrated Confucian public service, Taoist naturalism, and Buddhist detachment into a coherent life philosophy. He took duty seriously but didn't let setbacks destroy his equanimity.</p>"}
