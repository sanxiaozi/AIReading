Through vivid narrative, he makes accessible one of physics' most counterintuitive theories, showing how it upended our understanding of reality.","summary_medium":"<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>Quantum mechanics is notoriously difficult to understand—not mathematically, but conceptually. Cao Tianyan wrote this Chinese bestseller to make the history and philosophy of quantum theory accessible to general readers.</p><h2>The Revolution Begins</h2><p>Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger—the founders of quantum mechanics were often uncomfortable with what they discovered. Reality at the smallest scales defied common sense.</p><h2>The Interpretation Problem</h2><p>What does quantum mechanics mean? The Copenhagen interpretation says don't ask. Many-Worlds says every possibility exists. Pilot Wave theory restores determinism. None is fully satisfying.</p><h2>Living with Mystery</h2><p>Quantum mechanics works—it's the most precisely tested theory in science. But its meaning remains disputed. Perhaps some mysteries can be used without being solved.</p>"}
