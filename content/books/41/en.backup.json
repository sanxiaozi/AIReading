Animals overthrow their human master, establishing equality—until the pigs gradually assume all privileges. A devastating critique of totalitarianism, relevant wherever power corrupts idealism.","summary_medium":"<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>Animal Farm is Orwell's satire of Stalinism, but its lessons apply to any revolution betrayed. The pigs' gradual transformation from liberators to oppressors shows how power corrupts through incremental steps.</p><h2>The Revolution</h2><p>Old Major's dream inspires the animals to rebel. Their principles: all animals are equal, no animal shall kill another, no animal shall drink alcohol.</p><h2>The Betrayal</h2><p>The pigs take leadership. Gradually, each commandment is modified. 'No animal shall sleep in a bed... with sheets.' By the end, the pigs are indistinguishable from humans.</p>"}
