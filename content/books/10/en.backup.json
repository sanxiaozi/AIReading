  "summary_short": "Rowland Miller's Intimate Relationships is the definitive textbook on the science of close relationships. Drawing on decades of research, it reveals what makes relationships succeed or fail: attachment styles, communication patterns, and the ability to navigate conflict constructively. The core insight: lasting love is less about finding the right person and more about being the right partner.",
  "summary_medium": "<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>Rowland Miller synthesizes thousands of studies on relationships into a comprehensive guide. Unlike pop psychology, this book is grounded in rigorous research—from attachment theory to Gottman's marriage studies. It's the textbook for understanding how relationships actually work.</p><h2>Attachment Styles</h2><p>How you bonded with caregivers in childhood shapes how you connect in adult relationships:</p><p><strong>Secure:</strong> Comfortable with intimacy and independence. Trust comes easily. About 60% of people.</p><p><strong>Anxious:</strong> Crave closeness but fear abandonment. May become clingy or jealous. About 20%.</p><p><strong>Avoidant:</strong> Value independence over connection. Pull away when things get too close. About 20%.</p><p>The good news: attachment styles can change through awareness and healing relationships.</p><h2>The Four Horsemen</h2><p>John Gottman's research identified four behaviors that predict relationship failure: criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling. Couples who learn to replace these with gentler approaches—complaints instead of criticism, appreciation instead of contempt—dramatically improve their odds.</p><h2>Interdependence</h2><p>Healthy relationships balance autonomy and connection. Too much fusion leads to losing yourself; too much independence leads to disconnection. The goal is interdependence: two whole people choosing to share their lives.</p>",
  "summary_long": "<h2>Opening: The Science of Love</h2><p>We spend enormous energy on relationships—finding partners, maintaining connections, recovering from breakups. Yet most of what we believe about love comes from movies, songs, and folk wisdom rather than science.</p><p>Rowland Miller's textbook changes that. Drawing on decades of research from psychology, sociology, and neuroscience, it reveals what actually makes relationships work—and why they fail.</p><h2>Attachment Theory</h2><p>The foundation of adult relationships is laid in childhood. Psychologist John Bowlby discovered that how we bond with caregivers creates an internal 'working model' of relationships that persists into adulthood.</p><p><strong>Secure attachment:</strong> When caregivers were consistently responsive, children develop the belief that they're worthy of love and that others can be trusted. As adults, they're comfortable with both intimacy and independence. About 60% of people have secure attachment.</p><p><strong>Anxious attachment:</strong> When caregivers were inconsistent—sometimes responsive, sometimes not—children learn to be hypervigilant about their partners' availability. As adults, they crave closeness but fear abandonment, sometimes becoming clingy or jealous. About 20% of people.</p><p><strong>Avoidant attachment:</strong> When caregivers were consistently unresponsive, children learn to suppress their need for connection. As adults, they value independence and may pull away when relationships get too intimate. About 20% of people.</p><p><strong>The crucial insight:</strong> attachment styles aren't destiny. Through awareness and corrective experiences—especially in healing relationships—people can move toward more secure attachment.</p><h2>Attraction and Partner Selection</h2><p>Who we're attracted to isn't random, but it's also not as mysterious as it seems:</p><p><strong>Proximity:</strong> We tend to fall for people we see often. The mere exposure effect makes familiar faces more attractive.</p><p><strong>Similarity:</strong> Contrary to 'opposites attract,' research consistently shows we prefer partners similar to us in values, backgrounds, and even appearance.</p><p><strong>Reciprocity:</strong> We like people who like us. Knowing someone is interested makes them more attractive.</p><p><strong>Physical attractiveness:</strong> Matters more in initial attraction than long-term relationship satisfaction. And standards of beauty vary significantly across cultures and time.</p><h2>Communication Patterns</h2><p>How couples communicate predicts relationship success better than how compatible they seem on paper.</p><p>John Gottman, who can predict divorce with over 90% accuracy, identified four destructive patterns he calls 'The Four Horsemen':</p><p><strong>Criticism:</strong> Attacking your partner's character. 'You always...' 'You never...' Different from complaints, which address specific behaviors.</p><p><strong>Contempt:</strong> The most dangerous. Eye-rolling, sarcasm, mockery, name-calling. It communicates disgust and superiority.</p><p><strong>Defensiveness:</strong> Meeting complaints with excuses and counter-attacks. It tells your partner their concerns don't matter.</p><p><strong>Stonewalling:</strong> Withdrawing from interaction—shutting down, walking away, refusing to engage.</p><p><strong>The antidotes:</strong> Soft startups instead of criticism. Appreciation instead of contempt. Taking responsibility instead of defensiveness. Self-soothing and time-outs instead of stonewalling.</p><h2>Conflict and Repair</h2><p>All couples fight. The difference between happy and unhappy couples isn't the amount of conflict—it's how they handle it.</p><p>Key findings:</p><p><strong>Perpetual problems:</strong> 69% of relationship conflicts are never fully resolved—they're managed. Couples fight about the same things for years. Accepting this paradoxically reduces conflict.</p><p><strong>Repair attempts:</strong> What matters most is the ability to repair after conflict—through humor, affection, apology, or simply de-escalating. Happy couples have more successful repair attempts.</p><p><strong>The magic ratio:</strong> Stable relationships have at least 5 positive interactions for every negative one. When the ratio drops below 5:1, the relationship is in trouble.</p><h2>Intimacy and Self-Disclosure</h2><p>Intimacy grows through mutual self-disclosure—gradually sharing more personal information as trust builds. This creates a cycle: disclosure leads to feeling understood, which builds trust, which enables deeper disclosure.</p><p>The key is reciprocity. When one person shares vulnerably and the other responds with empathy and their own disclosure, intimacy deepens. When disclosure isn't reciprocated, it creates imbalance.</p><h2>Love Over Time</h2><p>Passionate love—the intense, obsessive, can't-stop-thinking-about-them feeling—peaks early and inevitably fades. This is biological: the brain can't sustain that level of activation.</p><p>What replaces it? Companionate love: deep affection, trust, shared history. It's less exciting but more stable. Couples who expect passion to last forever are disappointed; those who build on companionate love often thrive.</p><p>The research suggests love is less about finding the right person and more about being the right partner—through communication, commitment, and continual investment in the relationship.</p><h2>Interdependence</h2><p>Healthy relationships involve interdependence—a balance of autonomy and connection. Two complete individuals who choose to share their lives, maintaining their own identities while building something together.</p><p>Problems arise at the extremes: too much fusion (losing yourself in the relationship) or too much independence (emotional distance). The sweet spot is mutual support while respecting each person's need for space.</p><h2>Closing: Love as Skill</h2><p>Perhaps the most important finding from relationship science: <strong>love is a skill, not just a feeling.</strong> It can be learned, practiced, and improved.</p><p>This is both sobering and hopeful. Sobering because 'just loving each other' isn't enough. Hopeful because it means struggling relationships can be repaired, and good relationships can become great.</p>"
