Adler argues that reading difficult books requires specific techniques that can be learned.</p><h2>The Four Levels</h2><p>Elementary (basic literacy), Inspectional (systematic skimming), Analytical (thorough understanding), and Syntopical (comparing multiple books on a subject).</p><h2>Analytical Reading</h2><p>Classify the book. State what it's about. Outline its structure. Define its terms. Grasp its propositions. Follow its reasoning. Criticize fairly.</p>"}
