This gene's-eye view explains altruism, conflict, and cooperation. Revolutionary and controversial, it changed how we think about life and ourselves.","summary_medium":"<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>Darwin gave us evolution; Dawkins gave us a way to understand it at the genetic level. By treating genes as 'selfish' replicators—not conscious, but selected for their ability to make copies—Dawkins illuminated puzzles that organism-level thinking couldn't solve.</p><h2>Survival Machines</h2><p>We are 'survival machines—robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes.' Harsh, but clarifying. Our bodies exist because they helped genes replicate.</p><h2>The Evolution of Altruism</h2><p>How can altruism evolve if natural selection favors the selfish? Dawkins explains: if your sacrifice helps genetic relatives, your genes can still benefit. Kin selection explains why we help family more than strangers.</p><h2>Memes: Cultural Evolution</h2><p>In a speculative final chapter, Dawkins coins 'meme'—a unit of cultural transmission that replicates and evolves like genes. Ideas, songs, fashions—all subject to evolutionary dynamics.</p>"}
