Its publication in 1967 was a literary earthquake, winning the Nobel Prize for Literature and influencing writers worldwide.</p><h2>The Buendía Curse</h2><p>The family is marked by repetition: names recur, patterns repeat, history cycles. Their solitude—emotional isolation despite physical closeness—persists across generations.</p><h2>Macondo as Metaphor</h2><p>The town's founding, growth, and destruction parallel Latin American history: colonialism, civil war, foreign exploitation (the banana company), and ultimate oblivion.</p><h2>Magic and Reality</h2><p>Flying carpets, prophetic gypsies, a woman ascending to heaven while hanging laundry—García Márquez presents the miraculous as matter-of-fact, and the mundane as magical.</p>"}
