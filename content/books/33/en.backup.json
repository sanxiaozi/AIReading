Written while Hawking suffered from ALS, it became a surprise bestseller, proving that the public hungers for deep knowledge about our universe.","summary_medium":"<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>A Brief History of Time sold over 25 million copies, making cosmology a popular subject. Hawking's gift was explaining complex ideas without mathematics, using vivid analogies and dry wit.</p><h2>The Big Bang</h2><p>The universe began 13.8 billion years ago in an unimaginably hot, dense state and has been expanding ever since. Hawking explains what we know—and what we don't—about this origin.</p><h2>Black Holes</h2><p>Hawking's own research showed that black holes aren't completely black—they emit radiation (now called Hawking radiation). This discovery bridged quantum mechanics and gravity.</p><h2>The Arrow of Time</h2><p>Why does time flow in one direction? Hawking connects thermodynamics (entropy increases), cosmology (the universe expands), and psychology (we remember the past, not the future).</p>"}
