    "观察而不评判 - 将你看到的东西与你对它的判断分开",
    "表达感受，而不是想法 - '我感到沮丧' vs '我觉得你忽略了我'",
    "将感受与需求联系起来 - 每一种感受背后都有一种被满足或未被满足的需求",
    "提出请求，而不是要求 - 请求提供选择，要求会产生阻力",
    "在教育之前先产生同理心 - 在提供解决方案之前先倾听对方的感受和需求"

  "summary_short": "Marshall Rosenberg 的 <strong>非暴力沟通</strong> 教导了一种连接的语言，而不是冲突的语言。四个步骤：不带判断地观察，表达感受，确定潜在需求，并提出明确的请求。这一简单的框架改变了我们倾听和说话的方式——即使在最困难的对话中也能创造出理解。",
  "summary_medium": "<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>Marshall Rosenberg developed Nonviolent Communication (NVC) while working in schools during racial integration and later in conflict zones around the world. He discovered that how we speak matters as much as what we say. NVC is now used in therapy, business, education, and international mediation.</p><h2>The Four Components</h2><p><strong>1. Observation:</strong> State what you observe without evaluation. 'You left dishes in the sink' (observation) vs 'You're so messy' (evaluation). Mixing observation with evaluation triggers defensiveness.</p><p><strong>2. Feelings:</strong> Express genuine feelings—not thoughts disguised as feelings. 'I feel worried' is a feeling. 'I feel like you don't care' is a thought/judgment.</p><p><strong>3. Needs:</strong> Identify the need behind the feeling. Feelings arise from met or unmet needs—for safety, connection, autonomy, meaning, etc.</p><p><strong>4. Request:</strong> Make a clear, positive, doable request. 'Would you be willing to put your dishes in the dishwasher tonight?' Not a demand—a genuine request accepts 'no.'</p><h2>Empathic Listening</h2><p>Half of NVC is listening. When someone is upset, don't fix, advise, or explain. First, <strong>hear their feelings and needs</strong>. 'Are you feeling frustrated because you need more support?' This alone often resolves conflict.</p><h2>The Power of Needs</h2><p>All humans share universal needs: autonomy, safety, love, meaning, play. Conflicts arise at the level of strategies, not needs. When we understand each other's needs, creative solutions emerge.</p>",
  "summary_long": "<h2>Opening: A Language for Life</h2><p>Marshall Rosenberg grew up in a turbulent Detroit neighborhood where violence was common. He became fascinated with two questions: Why do people hurt each other? And why do some people stay compassionate even in horrible circumstances?</p><p>His search led to Nonviolent Communication—a way of speaking and listening that connects us to our own humanity and the humanity of others, even when we disagree deeply.</p><h2>What Makes Communication Violent?</h2><p>Rosenberg identifies 'life-alienating' communication patterns that disconnect us from compassion:</p><p><strong>Moralistic judgments:</strong> Labeling people as wrong, bad, selfish, lazy. Even when accurate, these labels trigger defensiveness rather than change.</p><p><strong>Making comparisons:</strong> Comparing yourself (or others) to an ideal creates misery. 'Why can't you be more like your sister?'</p><p><strong>Denial of responsibility:</strong> 'I had to do it.' 'Company policy made me.' We always have choice.</p><p><strong>Demands:</strong> When requests become demands, others have two options: submit or rebel. Neither is healthy.</p><h2>Component 1: Observation Without Evaluation</h2><p>The first step is describing what you observe without mixing in evaluation or interpretation.</p><p>Evaluation: 'You're always late.'<br>Observation: 'You arrived 20 minutes after we agreed to meet the last three times.'</p><p>Evaluation: 'He's a terrible communicator.'<br>Observation: 'He didn't respond to my last three emails.'</p><p>Why does this matter? <strong>When people hear criticism, they defend themselves.</strong> When they hear neutral observations, they're more likely to listen.</p><h2>Component 2: Expressing Feelings</h2><p>Next, express how you feel. But be careful: many 'feeling' words are actually evaluations in disguise.</p><p>'I feel ignored' isn't a feeling—it's what you think the other person is doing. 'I feel lonely' or 'I feel hurt' are feelings.</p><p>'I feel like you don't care' is a thought. 'I feel sad' is a feeling.</p><p>Genuine feelings include: happy, sad, scared, angry, confused, hopeful, relieved, frustrated, excited, anxious, grateful.</p><p><strong>Owning your feelings matters.</strong> 'You make me angry' gives your power away. 'I feel angry' keeps responsibility with you.</p><h2>Component 3: Connecting to Needs</h2><p>Behind every feeling is a need—met or unmet. When needs are met, we feel pleasant emotions (happy, relieved, grateful). When needs are unmet, we feel unpleasant emotions (sad, frustrated, anxious).</p><p>Universal human needs include: autonomy, celebration, creativity, integrity, interdependence, physical nurturance, play, spiritual communion, understanding.</p><p>The key insight: <strong>we have the same needs; we just use different strategies to meet them.</strong> A teenager who wants to stay out late has needs for autonomy and connection. A parent who wants them home has needs for their safety and peace of mind. The conflict is about strategies, not needs.</p><h2>Component 4: Making Requests</h2><p>Finally, make a clear request. Requests should be:</p><p><strong>Positive:</strong> Say what you want, not what you don't want. 'Would you put your phone away during dinner?' not 'Stop being on your phone.'</p><p><strong>Specific:</strong> 'Would you help me more around the house?' is vague. 'Would you wash the dishes tonight?' is clear.</p><p><strong>Doable:</strong> The person needs to be able to say yes. 'Would you love me more?' isn't actionable.</p><p>The difference between a request and a demand: <strong>a request accepts 'no' as an answer.</strong> If someone saying 'no' results in punishment or criticism, it was a demand.</p><h2>Empathic Listening</h2><p>NVC isn't just about speaking—it's about listening. When someone is upset, our instinct is to fix, advise, explain, or defend. Rosenberg suggests a different approach: <strong>empathize first.</strong></p><p>Empathy means connecting with the other person's feelings and needs. Not agreeing, not fixing—just understanding.</p><p>'It sounds like you're feeling frustrated because you need more acknowledgment for your work.'</p><p>'Are you feeling hurt because you value loyalty in friendships?'</p><p>Often, being heard is all people need. Once they feel understood, they're much more open to solutions.</p><h2>Receiving Criticism</h2><p>When someone criticizes you, you have four choices:</p><p>1. Blame yourself—accept the criticism as true</p><p>2. Blame them—attack back</p><p>3. Notice your own feelings and needs</p><p>4. Notice their feelings and needs</p><p>Options 3 and 4 keep connection alive. When someone says 'You're so selfish,' instead of defending, you can ask: 'Are you feeling frustrated because you need more consideration?'</p><h2>Closing: Compassion as a Practice</h2><p>NVC isn't about being nice or avoiding conflict. It's about staying connected to compassion—for yourself and others—even when you're angry, hurt, or frustrated.</p><p>The goal isn't perfect communication. It's remembering that behind every action, every criticism, every demand is a human being with needs—just like you. When we see each other clearly, solutions become possible.</p>"
