  "summary_medium": "<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>The Little Prince is one of the most translated books in the world, beloved by children and adults alike. Its deceptive simplicity contains deep truths about love, responsibility, and the blindness of 'grown-ups.'</p><h2>The Prince's Journey</h2><p>Leaving his tiny planet and his beloved rose, the prince visits asteroids inhabited by adults: a king, a businessman, a lamplighter. Each represents a way adults lose touch with what matters.</p><h2>The Fox's Secret</h2><p>'One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye.' The fox teaches the prince about taming—creating bonds that make something unique and precious.</p><h2>The Rose</h2><p>The prince realizes his rose is unique not because she's objectively special, but because of the time he invested in her. Love is about commitment, not comparison.</p>"
