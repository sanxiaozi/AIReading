  "summary_medium": "<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>The Kite Runner introduced many Western readers to Afghanistan—not as a war zone but as a place with its own culture, conflicts, and humanity. Hosseini's personal story of exile gave the novel authenticity.</p><h2>The Betrayal</h2><p>Young Amir witnesses his servant and best friend Hassan being assaulted but does nothing. This original sin haunts him for decades and shapes his relationship with his father.</p><h2>The Return</h2><p>As an adult in America, Amir returns to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan to rescue Hassan's son. His journey becomes a chance for redemption—and a confrontation with the past.</p><h2>Themes</h2><p>Guilt, atonement, father-son relationships, the impact of history on individuals, the possibility of moral redemption—the novel weaves personal and political with emotional power.</p>"
