While everyone's drowning in email and social media, those who can do deep work will thrive.

Newport argues this is a crisis—deep work produces value, but our environment systematically prevents it.</p><h2>Deep vs Shallow</h2><p>Deep work: cognitively demanding tasks performed without distraction. Shallow work: logistical tasks done while distracted. Most 'work' is shallow.</p><h2>The Rules</h2><p>Work deeply (schedule blocks, create rituals). Embrace boredom (train focus by resisting distraction). Quit social media (or limit dramatically). Drain the shallows (minimize low-value tasks).</p>"}
