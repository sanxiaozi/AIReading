  "summary_short": "乔治·奥威尔的反乌托邦小说描绘了一个永恒战争、无处不在的监视和公众操纵的世界。大哥哥在监视；思想警察惩罚；历史不断被改写。写于1948年，它仍然令人毛骨悚然地提醒人们注意极权主义和真相的腐败。",
  "summary_medium": "<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>1984 gave us 'Big Brother,' 'doublethink,' 'thoughtcrime,' and 'Newspeak'—vocabulary that helps us see and resist authoritarianism. Written as the Cold War began, it remains essential reading for understanding power and propaganda.</p><h2>Oceania</h2><p>Winston Smith lives in Airstrip One (formerly Britain), part of the superstate Oceania. The Party controls everything—past, present, and what people are allowed to think.</p><h2>The Party's Methods</h2><p>Surveillance (telescreens), propaganda (Ministry of Truth), fear (Room 101), and language control (Newspeak) combine to create a society where independent thought is nearly impossible.</p><h2>Winston's Rebellion</h2><p>Winston begins to question, to remember, to love. His rebellion is small but profound—and ultimately, tragically, crushed.</p>"
