Big Brother watches; the Thought Police punish; history is constantly rewritten. Written in 1948, it remains chillingly relevant as a warning about totalitarianism and the corruption of truth.","summary_medium":"<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>1984 gave us 'Big Brother,' 'doublethink,' 'thoughtcrime,' and 'Newspeak'—vocabulary that helps us see and resist authoritarianism. Written as the Cold War began, it remains essential reading for understanding power and propaganda.</p><h2>Oceania</h2><p>Winston Smith lives in Airstrip One (formerly Britain), part of the superstate Oceania. The Party controls everything—past, present, and what people are allowed to think.</p><h2>The Party's Methods</h2><p>Surveillance (telescreens), propaganda (Ministry of Truth), fear (Room 101), and language control (Newspeak) combine to create a society where independent thought is nearly impossible.</p><h2>Winston's Rebellion</h2><p>Winston begins to question, to remember, to love. His rebellion is small but profound—and ultimately, tragically, crushed.</p>"}
