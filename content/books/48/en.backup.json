The key insight: tiny changes compound dramatically. By making good habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying—and bad habits the opposite—you can transform your life without relying on motivation.","summary_medium":"<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>Most habit books focus on motivation. Clear focuses on systems: make good behaviors easy, bad behaviors hard. Environment beats willpower. Identity beats goals.</p><h2>The Four Laws</h2><p>Make it obvious (cue), make it attractive (craving), make it easy (response), make it satisfying (reward). Invert these for habits you want to break.</p><h2>Identity-Based Habits</h2><p>Don't focus on what you want to achieve—focus on who you want to become. 'I want to quit smoking' becomes 'I'm not a smoker.' Identity drives behavior.</p>"}
