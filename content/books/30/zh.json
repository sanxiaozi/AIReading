  "summary_short": "Phil Knight 的Nike创业回忆录读起来像是一部冒险小说。从用汽车出售鞋子到建立全球品牌，Knight 揭示了几乎破产、背叛和突破。关于运气、失败以及形象与现实之间的差距，他的坦率令人耳目一新。",
  "summary_medium": "<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>Nike is now ubiquitous, but its founding story is harrowing: constant cash crises, lawsuits from partners, a Japanese supplier playing games. Knight's candid account demystifies entrepreneurship and celebrates the people who made Nike possible.</p><h2>The Early Days</h2><p>Knight started by importing Japanese running shoes, selling them at track meets from his car. The economics were brutal: banks wouldn't lend, suppliers demanded payment, growth ate all profits.</p><h2>Building the Team</h2><p>Knight's 'Buttfaces' (his inner circle) were misfits who believed in the cause: a running coach, an accountant, an overweight salesman. Their loyalty sustained the company through crises.</p><h2>Going Public</h2><p>Nike's IPO solved the cash crisis but created new pressures. Knight reflects on what was gained and lost when a scrappy startup became a corporate giant.</p>"
