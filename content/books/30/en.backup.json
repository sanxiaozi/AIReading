From selling shoes out of his car to building a global brand, Knight reveals the near-bankruptcies, betrayals, and breakthroughs. Refreshingly honest about luck, failure, and the gap between image and reality.","summary_medium":"<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>Nike is now ubiquitous, but its founding story is harrowing: constant cash crises, lawsuits from partners, a Japanese supplier playing games. Knight's candid account demystifies entrepreneurship and celebrates the people who made Nike possible.</p><h2>The Early Days</h2><p>Knight started by importing Japanese running shoes, selling them at track meets from his car. The economics were brutal: banks wouldn't lend, suppliers demanded payment, growth ate all profits.</p><h2>Building the Team</h2><p>Knight's 'Buttfaces' (his inner circle) were misfits who believed in the cause: a running coach, an accountant, an overweight salesman. Their loyalty sustained the company through crises.</p><h2>Going Public</h2><p>Nike's IPO solved the cash crisis but created new pressures. Knight reflects on what was gained and lost when a scrappy startup became a corporate giant.</p>"}
