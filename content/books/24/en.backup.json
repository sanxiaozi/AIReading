Through six lives (emperor, officials, generals), he shows how the gap between Confucian moral ideals and institutional reality made meaningful reform impossible. A meditation on how systems trap individuals.","summary_medium":"<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>1587 was a year of no significance in Chinese history—no wars, rebellions, or major reforms. But Huang argues that in this ordinary year, we can see why the Ming dynasty would fall 57 years later. The forces that destroyed it were already at work.</p><h2>The Emperor's Dilemma</h2><p>The Wanli Emperor was intelligent but powerless. The system gave him symbolic authority but prevented real action. His withdrawal from governance was a rational response to an impossible situation.</p><h2>The Moral Trap</h2><p>Chinese governance relied on moral suasion rather than institutional checks. Officials were supposed to be virtuous, not merely competent. This created paralyzing conflicts between ideals and reality.</p><h2>System vs Individual</h2><p>Each figure in the book—reformers, generals, philosophers—tried to work within the system and failed. Their personal tragedies reveal structural problems no individual could solve.</p>"}
