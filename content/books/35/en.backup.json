From beehives to the internet, he reveals patterns of distributed control, adaptation, and evolution that characterize living systems and increasingly define our technology.","summary_medium":"<h2>Why This Book Matters</h2><p>Written in 1994, Out of Control predicted many developments: the rise of networked systems, the blurring of biology and technology, the power of swarm intelligence. Kelly, founding editor of Wired, synthesized insights from biology, computer science, and economics into a vision of the future.</p><h2>The Nine Laws of God</h2><p>Kelly identifies principles governing complex systems: distribute being, control from the bottom up, cultivate increasing returns, grow by chunking, maximize the fringes, honor errors, pursue no optima, seek disequilibrium, and change changes itself.</p><h2>Biologic vs Machinic</h2><p>The distinction between living systems and machines is breaking down. Our machines are becoming more biological (learning, adapting, evolving); our biology is becoming more engineered.</p>"}
